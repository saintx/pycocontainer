pycocontainer
=============

A small, lightweight dependency injection (IoC) container with component and dependency lifecycle management features written in and designed for writing idiomatic python.

Inspired by the seminal PicoContainer project at The Codehaus, but not in _any way_ associated with PicoContainer.  Also not a 'port' of PicoContainer to python.
